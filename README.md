This game was developed as a final project for C220 as part of a 48-hour game jam. 

When we considered the theme of Corona, we thought about it this way:
The current state of the world is pretty scary. People are dying from this virus,
and there's a lot of uncertainties. So, I wanted to do something light-hearted to help
everyone forget about all that's going on. 
Several shelters have been emptied due to people adopting pets during the quaratine. 
Many people are stuck at home, completely alone, and just in need of some companionship.
So this game allows you to adopt some animals and show them love. 

These are the struggles and surprises we encountered as we developed it:
My biggest technical challenge on this project was figuring out how to connect
the scriptable objects that held information about the animals to the functions/checks
that neeed to be ran. I'm fairly new to SOs, so it'll take me a bit to get a better grasp 
on them. I ended up just having event triggers on the UI that made whatever animal's information
you were hovering over into the child position 0, under a parent that would get the correct 
components from them. Probably not the best way to do it, but it was cool to see work.
I also ended up scraping the idea of animals making noise. Originally, they would bark or 
meow when clicked. However, since this is essentially just an idle clicker minus the auto-
mation, it quickly became insufferable hearing the sounds. Definitely the right call to cut
them.

These are the technologies and resources we used:
Unity 2019.2.0, GitKraken, GitHub, Adobe Audition, Visual Studio

All animals listed are available for adoption at the Bloomington Animal Shelter: https://bloomington.in.gov/animal-shelter/animals


This is the objective of the game:
Adopt as many pets as you want, and give them love.
Relax and forget about the scary world outside.

This is how the game is played:
Clicking is the only input.
To adopt an animal, click on the computer monitor. This pulls up the
adoption site. You can click and drag up the scrollbar to scroll through the available pets. If you have enough 
points, you can adopt certain pets. Click the adopt button, and they will spawn in 
your living room. Click the x in the corner to close the site and go back to the 
living room. Click on pets to give them love, and add points. Hit the escape key to bring up a pause
menu.

Future plans:
More interactions with animals. Would like to have them animate and wander the room.
Options for feeding, giving treats, and playing with toys. Open more rooms to the house.
Add more animals to adopt. Occasional sound effects such as purring, barking, etc. 
Automation for clicking through power ups (cat trees, toys, etc)
